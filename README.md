# Routines

```
$ crontab -l
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command
# */1 9-16 * * 1-5 /usr/bin/curl http://localhost/downloadAllCompanies > /dev/null 2>&1

```

#### After cloning create a folder with structure like this

1. /var/log/pse_monitor/raw_data/
2. /var/log/pse_monitor/raw_data/processed
3. sudo chown -R /var/log/pse_monitor/raw_data/
4. Then run the routines in order below.


#### Order of the routines:
1. downloadCompaniesAndPrices.php - This gets the data from the upstream server and put into the raw data.
2. harvestDownloadedCompaniesAndPrices.php - It harvests downloaded data.
3. materializeRawDataPerMinute.php - materializes the data to make it usuable.

Actually I do not use the above http request anymore but run it through php cli for security reasons.

### Sample SMS messaging

The AT+CMGS command sends an SMS message to a GSM phone. In text mode this command is less powerful than in PDU mode but it is certainly easier to use.

Parameters
<CR> = ASCII character 13
<CTRL-Z> = ASCII character 26
<mr> = Message Reference

AT+CMGF=1
OK
AT+CMGS="+639332162333"
> This is the text message.â†’
+CMGS: 198
OK
